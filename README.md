- I had another opportunity to practice flexbox. 

#### My learning notes from & tips from the community in feedback to this challenge (in detail):
 **:hover pseudo-class**
Be careful with placing the hover pseudo-class. ':hover element' is NOT the same
as 'element:hover'. The first will apply :hover pseudo-class when focusing any element on the 
page but the second will apply it only on the exact element. */

**width X max-width**
Be careful about the differences between 'max-width' and 'width' property.  Max-width is the
upper limit over which the element will never grow but it does not force the element to be
that size.

**font-weight**
Set only one (the lowest) font-weight in the body and then use recommended font-weights from 
style-guide.md only on particular elements and/or classes.

**accessibility practices - tips, tricks and links**
- Alt-text descriptions - do NOT use "image of..."
- Use focus visible styles at interactive elements, not only hovers.
- Do a lighthouse audit before you upload the solution.

**how to guess the dimensoins better if you do not have the exact data - tips, tricks and links**
- You can put all the design images on the design tool like Figma and try creating a box to kind of measure the size.
